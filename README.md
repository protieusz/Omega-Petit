# Omega-Petit
Integrated RP2040 with PMW3360 sensor with power level shifter, all in one mcu in the size of 49mm x 49mm pcb.

Small and portable enough for your custom keyboard pcb design that uses a trackball. JLCPCB quote for PCBA is around $77 CAD that does not include shipping.  I ordered all the components and will hot plate SMD solder myself.  BOM file will be uploaded in the future once my prototype pcbs arrives for testing.
JLCPCB is currently printing the pcbs on Jan 19, 2024.
